#WHAT IS JAVA SCRIPT?
# "JavaScript is a high-level, lightweight, interpreted, single-threaded, and dynamically typed programming language. It follows the synchronous programming model by default, but it also supports asynchronous operations through callbacks, promises, and async/await. Originally designed for client-side scripting to make web pages interactive, today with engines like V8 and environments like Node.js, JavaScript is widely used for both frontend and backend development."
