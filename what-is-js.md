# What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a **high-level, lightweight, interpreted, single-threaded, and dynamically typed programming language**. By default, it follows a synchronous programming model, but it also supports asynchronous operations through **callbacks, promises, and async/await**. It was originally designed for client-side scripting to make web pages interactive, but today, with powerful engines like **V8** and environments like **Node.js**, JavaScript is widely used for both frontend and backend development.

## Key Points
- **High-level** → Easy to read/write, hides low-level details  
- **Lightweight** → Uses less memory & resources  
- **Interpreted** → Executes line by line  
- **Single-threaded** → One operation at a time  
- **Async Support** → Can handle API calls, timers, without blocking main thread

## Example
```js
console.log("Hello, JavaScript!");
